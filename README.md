# Elafri

### An Engine focused on Simplicity and Tinkering

This Engine was written to help me (and others) bring simple ideas to life.
The vision is simplicity, customizability and tinkering. I try to keep the line
count as low as possible while also keeping it simple and easy to understand.
Why? Because I don't want to drown it in unnecessary features and I also want
it to be educational. The way I learned programming was through simple programs
that managed to take something really complex and make it simple

Elafri aims to provide 2D and 3D Graphics, ALSA Sound support, User Input,
Terminal and SDL support and any other modular extensions for certain things

#### People who can most benefit are those who:

* make non commercial and simple Linux programs
* mostly care about making a hobby project
* like to mess around and tinker with things
* value simplicity over richness and high performance

#### People who can't benefit are those who:

* don't use Linux
* don't use C
* require complex graphics and sound
* want to have portability

## Design

Elafri is designed with simplicity and developer freedom in mind.
The Engine does not make the code you write run on top of it or inside it.
Instead, the developer is the one who invokes Elafri and choses what code runs
and when it runs. The entire project aims to keep a low line count for the main
files as well as all the extensions

## Tinkering

I designed Elafri to very configurable and easy to explore.
All the source code files are in the same directory as your project and you have
maximum control over changing what happens without it being complicated to do so.
Many parts of the Engine can just be switched out and replaced and most of the
time, only Main() will get affected by that because of Elafri's modular design.
I took good care to keep a very simple design and even when you switch from the
Terminal to the SDL extension, only the input mechanisms will change

## Documentation

So far, since I am the sole developer of everything regarding Elafri, there is
no available documentation. However, it will likely be added at some point if
I don't abandon this project

## Contact Information

I am not sure if I will see an email as it is by pure chance that I check it

## Donations

I do not expect donations nor do I recommend them, they are less of a need
than they are an incentive for me to work more. I'm mostly just curious if
anyone would even donate for something like this.
